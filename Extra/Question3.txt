Tuple is immutable, no values can be added to a value in tuple whereas a list is a mutable data structure. Tuple is mostly
used to safeguard the data of great importance where the data doesn't need to be modified and needs to be kept safe. 

Tuple is also suitable for heterogenous data types, whereas list is mostly preferred for a single data typpe.

Since tuple is immutable, iterating through tuple is faster than in the list.
